# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Instructions

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files committed (101 files)
- ✅ `.env` file excluded (secrets are safe!)
- ✅ Ready to push to GitHub

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

2. **Create Repository**:
   - **Repository name**: `unified-mail` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `A modern unified email client with Gmail and Outlook integration`
   - **Visibility**:
     - ✅ Public (if you want to share)
     - ⚪ Private (for personal use)
   - **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
   - Click **"Create repository"**

3. **Copy the repository URL** shown on the next page:
   - It will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unified-mail.git`

4. **Run these commands** in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/eshwar/Desktop/omni-mail-view-main

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unified-mail.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Create via GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
cd /Users/eshwar/Desktop/omni-mail-view-main

# Create repository
gh repo create unified-mail --public --source=. --remote=origin

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Security Check

Before pushing, verify secrets are NOT included:

```bash
# This should show .env is ignored
git status --ignored

# This should NOT show .env
git ls-files | grep .env
```

✅ If `.env` doesn't appear, you're safe to push!

## 📝 After Pushing

Once pushed, your repository will be available at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unified-mail
```

You can then:
- ✅ Share the repository link
- ✅ Deploy to Vercel/Netlify directly from GitHub
- ✅ Collaborate with others
- ✅ Enable GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel from GitHub

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`
5. Deploy!

## 📊 What's Included in the Repository
